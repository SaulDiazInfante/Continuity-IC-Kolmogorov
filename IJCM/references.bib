This work is concerned with the construction of the Kolmogorov operator associated with the corresponding stochastic process expressed in terms of vorticity. The main result is that the Kolmogorov operator, defined on a space of smooth C2-functions, is essentially m-dissipative in L2(H0,μ) where H0 is a state space and μ an invariant measure.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop two ensemble time-stepping algorithms to solve the convection-diffusion equation with random diffusion coefficients, forcing terms and initial conditions based on the pseudo-spectral stochastic collocation method. The key step of the pseudo-spectral stochastic collocation method is to solve a number of deterministic problems derived from the original stochastic convection-diffusion equation. In general, a common way to solve the set of deterministic problems is by using the backward differentiation formula, which requires us to store the coefficient matrix and right-hand-side vector multiple times, and solve them one by one. However, the proposed algorithm only need to solve a single linear system with one shared coefficient matrix and multiple right-hand-side vectors, reducing both storage required and computational cost of the solution process. The stability and error analysis of the first- and second-order ensemble time-stepping algorithms are provided. Several numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical analyses and verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.},
